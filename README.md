# DataStructures
CS 300 Data Structures and Algorithms

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problem was creating a program that could read course data from a file, store it in a binary search tree, and provide various functionalities like sorting, displaying course information, and searching for specific courses.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand. 

I chose a binary search tree because it efficiently maintains sorted data, which is crucial for tasks like sorting the courses and looking them up by course number. Data structures are important because they determine how data is stored, accessed, and manipulated, which directly impacts the performance of the program.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project? 

I encountered challenges with file reading and ensuring the courses were inserted into the BST in a way that kept them sorted. I overcame these by carefully implementing the BST insertion logic and using proper file parsing techniques to load the course data.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project made me realize the importance of carefully choosing the right data structure for the task. I learned how to balance efficiency with simplicity and focused more on organizing my code to be modular and maintainable.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project reinforced the need for clear, well-structured code. I focused on using meaningful names, adding comments for clarity, and breaking down the code into manageable functions. I also prioritized ensuring that the program could easily be adapted or extended in the future.
